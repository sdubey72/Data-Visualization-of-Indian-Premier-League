Data Visualization using Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset


# Synopsis
#### The project focuses on explaining the summary of the data available in the IPL dataset in visual form. I have explored bar graphs and 3D plots using different plotting methods and packages.
#### I have also tried to explore different methods to extract data from the dataset using **numpy and Panda** 
#### Following libraries are used in Python 3.5 in the process.
```
pandas
numpy
matplotlib.pyplot
seaborn
plotly.plotly
plotly.graph_obj
mpl_toolkits.mplot3d 

```

# Motivation
#### This is final project for Data Visualization course by Dr. Bora Pajo,
#### Data Science Department, Mercyhurst University


# Intro to Indian Premier League Datset

Its an Indian professional Twenty20 cricket league contested during April and May of every year by teams representing Indian cities. The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007

The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and ranks sixth among all sports leagues. In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event in the world to be broadcast live on YouTube. The brand value of IPL in 2017 was US \$ 5.3 billion, according to Duff & Phelps. According to BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹11.5 billion (US\$182 million) to the GDP of the Indian economy

## Cricket Basics

* **Bat** : the wooden implement with which the batsman attempts to strike the ball
* **Ball** : the round object which the batsman attempts to strike with the bat. Also a delivery.
* **Batting** : the act and skill of defending one's wicket and scoring runs
* **Bowling** : the act of delivering the cricket ball to the batsman.
* **Bowling Average** : A bowler's bowling average is defined as the total number of runs conceded by the bowler divided by the number of wickets taken by the bowler. 
* **Batting Average** : A batsman's batting average is defined as the total number of runs scored by the batsman divided by the number of times he has been dismissed
* **Catch** : To dismiss a batsman by a fielder catching the ball after the batsman has hit it with his bat but before it hits the ground
* **Caught** :Its a method of dismissing a batsman in the sport of cricket. Being caught out is the most common method of dismissal at higher levels of competition. A batsman is out caught if a fielder catches the ball fully within the field of play without it bouncing once the ball has touched the striker's bat, glove or only the leg of the batsman.
* **Caught and bowled** : When a player is dismissed by a catch taken by the bowler.
* **Caught behind** : A catch by the wicket-keeper.
* **Four** : A shot that reaches the boundary after touching the ground, which scores four runs to the batting side.
* **Six** : a shot which passes over or touches the boundary without having bounced or rolled, so called because it scores six runs to the batting side
* **Hit wicket** : A batsman getting out by dislodging the bails of the wicket behind him either with his bat or body as he tries to play the ball or set off for a run.
* **Inning** : One player's or one team's turn to bat (or bowl). Unlike in baseball, the cricket term "innings" is both singular and plural.
* **LBW** : Leg Before Wicket, It means when there is leg in front of wicket then the batsman is given out, but bowler have to make an appeal to umpire.
* **Leg bye** : Extras taken after a delivery hits any part of the body of the batsman other than the bat or the gloved hand that holds the bat. If the batsman makes no attempt to play the ball with the bat or evade the ball that hits him, leg byes may not be scored
* **Match referee** : an official whose role is to ensure that the spirit of the game is upheld. 
* **No ball** : An illegal delivery; the batting side is awarded one extra, the bowler must deliver another ball in the over, and the batsman cannot be dismissed by the bowler on a no-ball. Most usually a front-foot no ball, in which the bowler oversteps the popping crease; other reasons include bowling a full toss above waist height (see beamer), throwing, having more than two fielders (excluding the wicketkeeper) behind square on the leg side, or breaking the return crease in the delivery stride
* **Non-striker** : The batsman standing at the bowling end
* **Obstructing the field** : It is one of the nine methods of dismissing a batsman in the sport of cricket. It dictates that either batsman can be given out if he wilfully attempts to obstruct or distract the fielding side by word or action.
* **Over** : The delivery of six consecutive legal balls by one bowler.
* **Retired out** : For a batsman to voluntarily leave the field during his innings, usually because of injury. A player who retires through injury/illness may return in the same innings at the fall of a wicket, and continue where he left off. A player who is uninjured may return only with the opposing captain's consent
* **Run out** : Dismissal by a member of the fielding side breaking the wicket while the batsman is outside his/her crease in the process of making a run.
* **Stump**
    - one of the three vertical posts making up the wicket ("off stump", "middle stump" and "leg stump");[2]
    - a way of dismissing a batsman in which the wicketkeeper breaks the batsman's wicket with the ball when the batsman is outside his crease but has not attempted a run; or
    - in a match lasting more than one day, "stumps" refers to the end of a day's play when the match is not complete (e.g. a progress score after the first day may be described as the score "at stumps on Day 1"). See also draw stumps
* **Toss** : In the sport of cricket, a coin is tossed to determine which team bats first. This is known as the toss.
* **Umpire** : one of the two (or three) enforcers of the laws[46] and adjudicators of play.
* **Wicket** : 
    - a set of stumps and bails;
    - the pitch; or
    - the dismissal of a batsman.
* **Wide** : A delivery that passes illegally wide of the wicket, scoring an extra for the batting side. A wide does not count as one of the six valid deliveries that must be made in each over – an extra ball must be bowled for each wide
* **Duckworth-Lewis(DL)** : A mathematically based rule that derives a target score for the side batting second in a rain-affected one-day match
* **Extra** : A run not attributed to any batsman;
    - there are five types: 
        - byes, 
        - leg byes, 
        - penalties, 
        - wides and 
        - no-balls. 
    - The first three types are called 'fielding' extras (i.e. the fielders are determined to be at fault for their being conceded) 
    - The last two are called 'bowling' extras (the bowler being considered to be at fault for their being conceded) which are included in the runs conceded by the bowler.
    

## Conclusion
Twenty20 match format is a form of limited overs cricket in that it involves two teams, each with a single innings, the key feature being that each team bats for a maximum of 20 overs. 
Hate or Love, one cant ignore IPL !
